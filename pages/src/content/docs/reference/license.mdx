## Frequently Asked Questions
<details>
    <summary> <b>What are the differences between the features of the commercial license and the open-source version?</b></summary>
    There are no differences. The code corresponding to the commercial license and the open-source license is exactly the same.

    smart-servlet uses a dual licensing model of AGPL-3.0 and commercial licenses, allowing you to choose the license type based on your needs.
</details>

<details>
    <summary> <b>Do I need to purchase a commercial license to use it in a commercial environment?</b></summary>
    No. The core and open-source plugins of smart-servlet are under the AGPL 3.0 license.
    As long as you comply with the license and retain the copyright and version information of smart-servlet, you can use it for free.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>In what situations do I need to purchase a commercial license?</b></summary>
    If you have any of the following requirements, you need to purchase a commercial license:

    - You have modified the code of smart-servlet or extended your own plugins, but you do not want to open-source these outputs under the AGPL license.
    - You have integrated smart-servlet into your product, but you do not want to open-source your product under the AGPL license.
    - You hope to receive advanced technical support from the smart-servlet team.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>How should I understand "permanent authorization"?</b></summary>
    It does not expire and does not require annual payment. Once you purchase a commercial license or commercial plugin, you will receive permanent authorization for the current root version and can use it indefinitely.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>What is a "root version"?</b></summary>
    The licensing scope for commercial licenses and commercial plugins is one root version, such as from 1.0 to 1.x.

    When upgrading across root versions, such as from 1.x to 2.x, you can purchase at a 50% discount.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>How long is the validity period of advanced technical support for commercial licenses and commercial plugins?</b></summary>
    The validity period of technical support is 6 months.

    We believe that during this period, your team can fully master the usage of this version and verify whether this version meets your needs.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Can the commercial edition be tried out?</b></summary>
    Yes.

    Contact us to obtain a commercial edition with a runtime validity of 30 minutes.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>Does smart-servlet support javax-servlet?</b></summary>
    Customized services are supported.

    smart-servlet was initially based on the javax-servlet 4.0 specification. Given the product positioning of smart-servlet, continuing to invest in javax-servlet is not conducive to project development.

    If you have such requirements, you can try customized services.
